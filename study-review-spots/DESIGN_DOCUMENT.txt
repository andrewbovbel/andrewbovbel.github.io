THE MARAUDER'S MAP OF STUDY SPOTS - DESIGN DOCUMENT
McMaster University Study Space Discovery Platform

OVERVIEW

The people who would use this app are primarily McMaster University students who need to find suitable study spaces on campus. This includes undergraduate and graduate students looking for quiet zones for focused studying, collaborative spaces for group projects, or comfortable environments that match their learning preferences and schedules. Currently, students tend to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from friends or aimlessly exploring campus buildings, which often leads to frustration when they discover spaces are overcrowded, too noisy, missing essential amenities, or require bookings they weren't aware of. There are different types of students to consider: those who are new to campus and unfamiliar with available spaces, commuter students with limited time between classes, and international students navigating an unfamiliar environment with different cultural expectations about study spaces.

Students currently struggle with finding reliable information about study locations because this information is scattered across different campus resources, outdated websites, or simply doesn't exist in a centralized format. The lack of consolidated information means students waste valuable study time traveling to locations that don't meet their needs, arrive during closed hours, or discover spaces require advance booking when they expected walk-in access. The frustration is particularly acute during exam periods when efficient use of study time becomes critical for academic success.

Characteristics:

• Use mobile devices and web applications regularly for academic and social purposes
• Have diverse study preferences requiring different environments (quiet zones versus collaborative spaces)
• Need quick access to location information between classes or during limited campus time
• Some are new to campus and unfamiliar with building locations and available spaces
• Some are commuter students who must plan study sessions carefully due to limited campus time
• Some are international students navigating unfamiliar campus geography and cultural norms
• Characterized by a desire for fast, reliable information before committing time to visit locations
• Can access and use web applications with ease

Needs/Challenges:

• Hard to discover suitable study locations across a large campus
  o Information about study spaces is scattered across different campus resources or not available
  o Students often don't know about quiet zones on specific library floors or specialized study rooms
  o It's difficult to understand which spaces match specific needs like noise level, amenities, or booking requirements

• Uncertainty about space quality and availability before visiting
  o Students arrive at locations only to find them overcrowded, too noisy, or missing essential amenities
  o Unclear operating hours lead to wasted trips when students arrive during closed periods
  o Booking requirements are not always clear, causing frustration when students expect walk-in access

• Difficulty matching study environments to specific task requirements
  o A student preparing for an exam needs different amenities than one working on a group project
  o Personal preferences about noise tolerance and study style are hard to match without detailed information
  o Limited knowledge about which spaces welcome all students versus department-specific access

USER GROUPS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

Understanding who uses our application is crucial for building features that actually solve real problems. We've identified three primary user groups, each bringing unique perspectives and challenges to finding study spaces on campus.

The first group consists of undergraduate students navigating their academic journey. These students often juggle multiple courses simultaneously, which means they need study environments that match different learning tasks throughout their day. A morning calculus problem set might require complete silence, while an afternoon group project discussion needs a collaborative space with whiteboards and tables. Undergraduate students also tend to have irregular schedules with gaps between classes, creating a need for quick discovery of nearby study spots that fit their available time windows. Many undergraduates are new to campus or haven't explored beyond the main library, so they benefit from visual discovery and clear categorization of space types. Additionally, budget-conscious students appreciate knowing which spots are free versus requiring bookings that might have associated costs.

The challenges these students face stem from the overwhelming size of McMaster's campus. Walking around trying to find a good spot wastes precious study time, especially during midterm and final exam seasons when every hour counts. There's also the frustration of arriving at a location only to discover it's overcrowded, too noisy despite being labeled as quiet, or missing essential amenities like power outlets for laptops. Students often rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from friends, which limits their options and doesn't account for personal preferences regarding noise tolerance or study style.

Commuter students represent our second user group with distinctly different needs. These students typically have limited time on campus between classes or work commitments, making efficiency in location discovery absolutely critical. They're often less familiar with campus buildings beyond their primary class locations, so navigation assistance through Google Maps integration becomes essential rather than optional. Commuter students also need to plan their study sessions more carefully since they can't just return to a residence room if a space doesn't work out. They value knowing booking requirements upfront because they might need to reserve spaces in advance to guarantee availability during their limited campus time. Additionally, commuter students often carry more belongings and value information about which spaces offer secure storage options.

The challenges for commuter students center around uncertainty and planning. Without the luxury of exploring campus casually, they need reliable information before committing to traveling to a location. Unclear operating hours create frustration when students arrive during closed periods, wasting their already limited time. The unpredictability of space availability during peak hours is particularly problematic for commuters who can't afford to visit multiple locations in search of an open spot.

International students form our third key user group, bringing cultural perspectives and navigation challenges unique to those new to Canadian academic environments. These students often have different expectations about study space norms and behaviors, making detailed reviews from other students particularly valuable for understanding unspoken rules and cultural context. International students may struggle with building names and location descriptions when everything is unfamiliar, so visual elements like maps and photos become more important than text alone. Language barriers, while minimal for academic English, can make understanding facility rules or booking procedures more challenging when information isn't clearly presented. These students also benefit from community-driven content that reveals insider knowledge about which spaces are welcoming versus those that might feel exclusionary.

International students face challenges around information accessibility and cultural adaptation. Technical jargon or assumption of prior campus knowledge in location descriptions creates barriers to discovery. Uncertainty about which spaces are available to all students versus department-specific creates hesitation to explore new areas. The booking systems used across different buildings vary, and without clear explanations of requirements, international students may miss opportunities or arrive unprepared.

ADDITIONAL TASKS AND FUNCTIONS

The application provides comprehensive study place listings that enable users to browse a complete catalog of study spaces on campus, including both indoor locations like libraries and quiet zones, and outdoor or scenic spaces. The Browse Study Spots page displays all available locations in a searchable, filterable list that accommodates diverse study preferences and needs. This comprehensive listing addresses the fundamental challenge of discovering study spaces across a large campus where information is typically scattered or incomplete.

The comprehensive multi-filter system allows users to combine criteria like type, noise level, booking requirements, and specific amenities, enabling precise matching to individual study session needs. The search functionality enables users to find study places based on location names, building descriptions, or any text content, while filters allow refinement by factors relevant to study space selection including noise levels, crowdedness indicators through ratings, proximity to amenities like food services, and other practical considerations that students care about when choosing study locations. This directly tackles the undergraduate student challenge of matching environments to task requirements, as someone preparing for a final exam can filter specifically for quiet zones with 24/7 access and power outlets. The booking requirement filter solves a critical pain point for commuter students by clearly distinguishing walk-in locations from reservation-only spaces before they travel.

The review and rating system transforms our application from a simple directory into a community-driven knowledge base. Real student reviews reveal information that official facility descriptions don't capture, such as peak hour crowding patterns, specific seating recommendations, or unexpected challenges like poor WiFi in certain corners. For international students, reviews provide cultural context about study space norms and help them understand behavioral expectations. Reviews also help students make more informed decisions by reading about actual experiences rather than relying solely on official descriptions. Users can submit reviews through a modal form that collects their name, star rating from one to five, and written comments about their experience.

The favorites system enables users to save their preferred study spots for quick access, addressing the challenge of remembering which locations worked well for specific study tasks. When students find a spot that matches their needs perfectly, they can save it to their favorites list accessible through the navigation bar, eliminating the need to search again for locations they've already identified as suitable. This feature is especially valuable for commuter students who need to quickly access their go-to study locations without repeating search processes during limited campus time.

The visited places tracking automatically records which study spots users have viewed, creating a personal history of explored locations. This feature helps students remember which spots they've already considered, preventing redundant exploration and supporting decision-making by maintaining context about previously reviewed options. The visited badge appears in the sidebar when viewing a spot's detail page, providing immediate feedback that the location has been explored.

The add new study spot functionality allows users to contribute locations to the community database through a comprehensive form that captures all essential information including name, location, type, noise level, amenities, description, and hours. This community-driven expansion addresses the challenge of incomplete or outdated information by enabling students to share newly discovered spaces or update information about existing locations. Newly added spots are marked with a distinctive NEW badge and include a moderation notice explaining that the spot was added via the moderation system, encouraging users to provide reviews and ratings to help validate and improve the information.

The notification system for featured spots provides immediate feedback when study spots receive significant community validation through high ratings. When five or more reviews with four-star or higher ratings are submitted within a thirty-minute window, the system automatically features those spots and displays a notification alerting users to newly featured locations. This dynamic featuring mechanism ensures that spots receiving positive community feedback gain visibility, helping other students discover high-quality study environments that have been validated by peer experiences.

Google Maps integration addresses location uncertainty across all user groups but is particularly valuable for commuter students navigating efficiently between classes and study locations, and international students less familiar with campus geography. The featured study spots section on the home page serves discovery needs for first-year and international students who may not know where to begin exploring.

DESIGN JUSTIFICATIONS

Home Screen

The justification for the home screen interface considers several principles and user needs to make it intuitive for users to discover and access study spaces. This screen serves as the primary entry point where users first interact with the application, making it critical that core functionality is immediately apparent and accessible.

Relevant user needs for this screen include discovering study spots without knowing specific locations, quickly accessing search functionality, understanding how the application works, and finding recommended locations that might match their needs. Students new to campus or unfamiliar with available spaces particularly benefit from visual discovery features, while commuter students with limited time need immediate access to search capabilities.

Visibility and Affordance Principles

To address the need for immediate search access, I applied Norman's visibility principle which states that important system capabilities should be clearly apparent through design. The prominent search bar positioned in the center of the top section makes the search function highly visible and immediately accessible. The search input field employs Norman's affordance principle through its rectangular shape and placeholder text that clearly communicates both interactivity and expected input type. The search button positioned immediately adjacent to the input creates visual grouping, indicating their functional relationship. This design directly addresses the user need for immediate access to search functionality, particularly valuable for commuter students with limited time who need to locate study spots quickly between classes. [Upload screenshot: Home page top section showing the centered search bar with input field and search button clearly visible]

This redundancy supports different user preferences and discovery styles, whether users want to search with specific criteria or explore all available options. [Upload screenshot: Home page showing the Browse All Spots button positioned below the search form]

Figure-Ground and Visual Hierarchy Principles

The top section uses Gestalt's figure-ground principle where the top content stands out distinctly from surrounding background elements. Large typography establishes clear visual hierarchy guiding attention to the primary search function as the focal point. The McMaster University badge serves as a visual anchor establishing institutional context and defining the beginning of the content hierarchy. Ample whitespace around the top section creates clear separation from other page elements, helping users focus on primary actions without distraction. [Upload screenshot: Full home page showing top section with large typography, badge, and clear visual hierarchy with ample whitespace]

Proximity and Similarity Principles

The featured study spots section uses a card-based grid layout that demonstrates Gestalt principles of proximity and similarity. The grid structure follows the law of proximity indicating related function, where cards positioned close together are perceived as a related group of recommended locations. Consistent visual structure across all featured spot cards enables quick scanning through the law of similarity, with each card following the same layout pattern: image at top, spot name, location link, and rating metadata. This consistency creates visual rhythm that supports efficient scanning, allowing users to quickly compare multiple options without detailed reading. The dashed border styling on cards creates clear boundaries following the law of closure, helping users perceive each card as a complete distinct unit. [Upload screenshot: Featured Study Spots section showing grid layout with three spot cards displaying consistent structure, images, names, locations, and ratings]

Feedback Principle

Hover effects on featured spot cards provide immediate visual feedback following Norman's feedback principle, confirming cards are interactive before users commit to clicking them. When users hover over a card, it elevates slightly with enhanced shadow and border changes, communicating interactivity clearly. This addresses the discovery challenge faced by first-year and international students who may not know where to begin exploring campus study locations, as the visual feedback guides them toward interactive elements. [Upload screenshot: Featured spot card with hover state showing elevation and enhanced styling]

Browse Study Spots Screen

The justification for the Browse Study Spots screen considers user needs around efficiently finding study locations that match specific criteria, maintaining awareness of active filters, and understanding search results. This screen addresses the core challenge of discovering suitable study spaces across a large campus where students need to filter by multiple factors simultaneously.

Relevant user needs include searching for spots by name or description, filtering by multiple criteria like type and noise level, understanding which filters are active, seeing how many results match current criteria, and comparing multiple options quickly. Commuter students particularly benefit from efficient filtering that helps them find suitable spots before committing time to travel, while undergraduate students need to match environments to specific study task requirements.

Visibility Principle

The Browse Study Spots page implements a split-panel layout that directly addresses the user need to maintain filter visibility while browsing results, following Norman's visibility principle. The persistent left sidebar ensures filter selections remain visible and accessible at all times, eliminating the need for users to remember their filter choices or repeatedly open filter menus. This design addresses frustration where users lose track of active filters and must restart searches, a common problem when filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously. The persistent visibility of filters supports efficient decision-making by allowing users to see and adjust criteria while viewing results. [Upload screenshot: Browse Study Spots page showing split-panel layout with filter sidebar on left and search results on right, demonstrating persistent filter visibility]

Common Region Principle

Each filter group uses consistent visual structure with labels positioned above controls, following Gestalt's common region principle that groups labels with associated controls. The filter panel itself creates a distinct visual region separated by borders and background color, clearly grouping all filtering functionality together. This grouping helps users understand which controls affect which aspects of search results, reducing cognitive load when working with multiple filters simultaneously. Filter labels use clear user-centered language that directly communicates what each filter controls, avoiding technical jargon that might confuse international students. [Upload screenshot: Filter panel close-up showing all filter groups with labels above controls, demonstrating common region grouping and consistent structure]

Constraints Principle

Dropdown menus for Type, Noise Level, and Booking Required follow Norman's constraints principle by providing limited sets of valid choices that prevent invalid selections and reduce input errors. Users can only select from predefined options like Library, Quiet Zone, Cafe, or Scenic for type, and Quiet, Moderate, or Lively for noise level. This constraint prevents users from entering invalid or inconsistent values, ensuring search results are meaningful and filterable. The clear visual hierarchy of dropdown options makes selection straightforward, and the consistent styling across all dropdowns follows Gestalt's similarity principle, helping users quickly understand how to interact with different filter types. [Upload screenshot: Filter panel showing Type dropdown with options visible, Noise Level dropdown, and Booking Required dropdown, demonstrating constraint principle with limited valid choices]

Mapping Principle

The amenities filter uses checkboxes rather than dropdowns, following Norman's mapping principle where the control type matches the selection nature, naturally communicating that multiple selections are possible. Checkboxes are universally understood as allowing multiple simultaneous selections, whereas dropdowns typically suggest single-choice selection. This design choice reduces cognitive load and prevents user confusion about whether they can select multiple amenities. The checkbox interface makes it immediately clear that users can filter by WiFi and Power Outlets and Group Study Areas simultaneously, for example. [Upload screenshot: Amenities filter section showing multiple checkboxes with several amenities selected, demonstrating mapping principle where control type matches selection nature]

Feedback Principle

Real-time filtering provides immediate feedback following Norman's feedback principle, confirming user actions have been recognized and processed instantly. As users adjust filters, results update dynamically without requiring a submit button, creating a responsive and intuitive interaction model. The results counter displays Found X study spots providing explicit feedback about how many spots match the current filter combination, addressing the user need to understand filter effectiveness. This immediate feedback loop helps users understand how filter selections affect available options in real-time, allowing iterative criterion adjustment without frustration. [Upload screenshot: Search results area showing filtered results with result counter displaying "Found X study spot(s)" and multiple result cards visible]

The Add Study Spot button in the page header provides immediate access to community contribution functionality, following the visibility principle by making this feature clearly apparent.

Similarity and Proximity Principles

Search result cards use consistent visual structure enabling quick comparison across multiple spots following Gestalt principles of similarity and proximity. Each card follows the same layout pattern: image on the left, spot name as the primary text element, location link, description, tags showing type and noise level, and metadata including star ratings and amenities. Information is displayed in the same order and format allowing rapid scanning without detailed reading. This consistency creates visual rhythm that supports efficient scanning, particularly valuable for undergraduate students comparing multiple options quickly to find the best match for their current study task. Cards positioned close together in a vertical list are perceived as a related group of options, following the proximity principle. [Upload screenshot: Search results showing multiple result cards with consistent structure, displaying images, names, locations, descriptions, tags, and ratings in identical layout pattern]

For newly added spots, a green NEW badge appears in the top-right corner of result cards, providing immediate visual indication that the spot was added via moderation. The badge's distinctive color and position follow Gestalt's figure-ground principle by making it stand out while not obscuring card content. When users hover over the badge, a tooltip explains that the spot was added via moderation and encourages reviews, following Norman's visibility principle by providing additional context when needed. [Upload screenshot: Search result card with NEW badge visible in top-right corner, and tooltip appearing on hover]

Spot Detail Screen

The justification for the Spot Detail screen considers user needs around accessing comprehensive information about study locations, understanding space characteristics, reading community feedback, and taking actions like saving favorites or writing reviews. This screen serves as the complete information destination where users make final decisions about visiting locations.
